# Hi, I'm Vedant! 👋  
I make computers do things. ⚙️💻

## Tech I build with(for now):
- **Next.js**  
- **React**  
- **Node.js**  
- **Go**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **Prisma**  
- **Docker**

## What I'm up to:
- ⚡ Making frontends *fast* and creating **experiences**, not just pages.
- ☕ Turning coffee into code (success rate: 60%, but improving!).
- 🐳 Convincing Docker containers to play nice.
- 🛠️ i3 config + Neovim rabbithole explorer (send help?).

## I love building stuff—just for the heck of it! 🚀  
Often collaborating with [@thedemonsid](https://github.com/thedemonsid) (great ideas, even better times).

## Collab? 🤝  
Got an idea that doesn’t suck? Hit me up, I’m in!
